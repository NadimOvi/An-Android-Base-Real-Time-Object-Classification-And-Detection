Point camera at things to learn how to say them in a different language.

Native Android App built with [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native).

Made it as a part of my learning process of [React](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) and [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native).

Inspired by [Thing Translator](https://github.com/dmotz/thing-translator) by [dmotz](https://github.com/dmotz).

## How it works ?

Concepts present in captured image are extracted and translated to the given language.

It uses

- [Clarifai's](https://clarifai.com/) concept recognition from images
- [Yandex's](https://tech.yandex.com/translate/) language translation.


## Download Signed Release for Android

[what_the_thing_1.1.0-release.apk](https://github.com/vigzmv/what_the_thing/releases/tag/v1.1.0)


## Try it ?

Get the signed release apk for android from [here](https://github.com/vigzmv/what_the_thing/releases/tag/v1.1.0) or follow the steps to build it yourself.

Have a look at the [React-native Docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) to set up a development environment for React-native and Android.

```sh
# Install react-native
$ sudo npm install -g react-native-cli

# Clone repository
$ git clone https://github.com/vigzmv/what_the_thing.git
$ cd what_the_thing

```

Get your free API keys from [Clarifai](https://clarifai.com/) and [Yandex](https://tech.yandex.com/translate/). It is easy and free.

Place them in `./apiKeys.json`.

```sh
# Install required packages
$ yarn install || npm install

# Install the application on a running Android emulator or a connected Android device
$ react-native run-android

# Run the server/bundler
$ react-native start

# Done !
```

<hr/>

For a build that doesn't reqire the development server:

```sh

# Bundle debug build
$ react-native bundle --dev false --platform android --entry-file index.android.js --bundle-output ./android/app/build/intermediates/assets/debug/index.android.bundle --assets-dest ./android/app/build/intermediates/res/merged/debug

# Create debug build
$ cd android && ./gradlew assembleDebug

# Generated apk will be located at android/app/build/outputs/apk. Install it with
$ adb install app/build/outputs/apk/app-debug.apk

```


_I would be releasing a signed apk package soon which could be installed directly to device for usage._
