# What the Thing ?

Point camera at things to learn how to say them in a different language.

Native Android App built with [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native).

Made it as a part of my learning process of [React](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) and [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native).

Inspired by [Thing Translator](https://github.com/dmotz/thing-translator) by [dmotz](https://github.com/dmotz).
